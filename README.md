# ChinaTown Cheap Eats

- https://lucid-fermi-523f43.netlify.app/#

I watched a series of videos that toured different food locations in NYC's Chinatown, the series had the goal of helping local businesses.
Being Chinese American and having worked near Chinatown, I wanted to try out some of these spots. I created a site that gathered the videos and allowed users to jumped to different locations in each video and see information about the location along with which dishes were eaten and the position on google maps.
